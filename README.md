# Universal Time and Tick Suppression: A Realistic Interpretation of Relativistic Effects

We present a realist reinterpretation of relativistic phenomena, *Universal Time and Tick Suppression*. Time is taken not as an observer–relative parameter but as a universal, dynamic axis: a smooth future-directed timelike field $\(U\)$ along which the total mass–energy of the universe advances. Effects usually described as “time dilation” are recast as *tick suppression*: a physical slowing of internal processes (clocks, decays) due to the energy cost of sustaining motion through space or persisting in gravitational fields. This energy–allocation mechanism is formalized as the *Inertial Suppression Principle*, providing a causal reading that is operationally equivalent to standard relativity while ontologically distinct. We also specify a light-based calibration of duration, using local MCIFs and $\(c\)$, that is independent of potentially suppressed clocks. The framework unifies kinematic and gravitational slowdowns under a single mechanism, preserves all empirical predictions, and offers a clear, absolute (yet physical) notion of time that clarifies puzzles of simultaneity without altering relativistic phenomenology.

## Quick Roadmap

1. **Admissible clocks** — periodic, reproducible, calibrable; $c=\lambda_B/\tau_B$.  
2. **Duration (operational)** — $\Delta t^{(B)}=N_B\tau_B\$ ; optional $\Delta t^{(B)}=\Delta s_B/c\$ with $\Delta s_B=N_B\lambda_B\$.  
3. **Principle (Relational time)** — only relations between processes are measurable; ideal clocks realize proper time locally.  
4. **Dynamic axis** — time is generated by process advance; becomes the fourth coordinate in a $3{+}1\$ Lorentzian chart.  
5. **Future additions** — radar synchronization, light-clock dilation, invariant interval, clock-equivalence lemma, GR extension, quantum Ramsey clocks.
